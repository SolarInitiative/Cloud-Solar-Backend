# Project Overview

This project is the backend for the Cloud Solar application. The platform allows users who cannot install their own solar panels (e.g., apartment dwellers) to buy or lease solar panels in a remote solar farm. The electricity generated by these panels is supplied to the grid, and the user gets credit that offsets their own electricity charges.

The backend is built with Python using the FastAPI framework, with a PostgreSQL database and SQLAlchemy for data management. Authentication is handled by SuperTokens.

## Key Technologies

*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Alembic
*   **Authentication:** SuperTokens
*   **API:** RESTful API with Pydantic data validation

# Building and Running

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   PostgreSQL
*   An active SuperTokens instance

## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Application

1.  Set up your environment variables. You can copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values for your database and SuperTokens instance.
2.  Run the database migrations:

    ```bash
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

3.  Start the FastAPI application:

    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

# Development Conventions

## Database Migrations

All database schema changes should be managed through Alembic migrations. To create a new migration, use the following command:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Your migration message"
```

Then, apply the migration:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Code Style

This project does not currently have a defined code style guide or linter configuration. It is recommended to use a tool like Black or Flake8 to ensure consistent code formatting.

## API Documentation

The API documentation is automatically generated by FastAPI and is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the application is running.
